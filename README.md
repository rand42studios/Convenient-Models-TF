# Convenient Models for Tensorflow

Perhaps you've came across some excellent neural network models in academic literature but had no time to implement them yourself in Tensorflow. Just copy my code and pasted it for your projects!

## Sequence Modeling
- Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)
- Temporal Convolutional Attention-Based Network (TCAN)
  - Multi-Head Attention variant
- Temporal Convolutional Attention Neural Network (TCANN)
- EEMD-TCN
- EEMD-LSTM

## Image Recognition
- ResNet
- ResNeXt
- DenseNet
